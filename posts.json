        "text": "# Hi and welcome to my first blog post\nThis blog site is something i've been coding for a while, using the *marked* library.\n\nAt first, it started with me testing out the marked library, then I noticed videos are not being embedded, so I spent time getting it to work\n\nSince it works now, here's a video of a cat named Maxwell.\n\n[video](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/822365198743896094/1086723680635211887/maxwell2.mp4)\n\n<em style=\"font-size: 15px;\">i (hate) love regex!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</em>\n\n# Comments and the backend\nRight now, I am not sure how to implement this since the backend server for this site is hosted with [repl.it](https://replit.com/). By default, the servers repl.it has are very bad. I get like 0.5 vCPUs, 512 MB of RAM, and 1,024 MBs of storage just for a server, and this is not enough for comments.\n\nThe second problem is the account system, as it usually helps in reducing spam. I do not know what service to use for this, and even if I knew one, there's a high possibility it's either paid or not compatible for use with repl.it.\n\n# Why did I make this site\nEver since I got access to the YouTube community tab, this seemed like the only way of posting updates for specific stuff and the channel. However, at 06/04/2023, YouTube randomly disabled my ability to make any new community posts.\n\n![Community tab and the channel](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/822365198743896094/1093902201170178108/firefox_eJcxEtMRVw.png)\n\nThis came out of nowhere and I still dont know why this happened\n\n# Source code\nThis site is open-source on GitHub. The backend server is also open-source on GitHub. You are allowed to self-host this site all you want, but you have to credit Voxelstice (this project is simple but it took hours to make)",
